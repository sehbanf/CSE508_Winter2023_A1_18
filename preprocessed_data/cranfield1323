investigation use auxiliary slot establish laminar flow low drag aerofoils use auxiliary slot laminar flow aerofoil investigated check whether laminar flow established suction rear region deposited dirt flies etc results indicate absence unfavourable pressure gradients possible establish laminar boundary layer removing little whole turbulent layer reaching slot preliminary estimates suggest efficient ducting possible achieve reduction overall effective drag coefficient means
