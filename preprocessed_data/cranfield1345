use aerodynamic lift entry earth atmosphere employing aerodynamic lift entry earth atmosphere either orbital escape velocity range allowable entry angles prescribed peak deceleration greatly increased total heat energy transferred vehicle held value nonlifting vehicle modest lift drag ratios required beyond peak g prevent deceleration exceeding peak value prevent vehicle skipping earth atmosphere thus difficult guidance control problem greatly alleviated particular return moon planets necessity multiple pass drag braking eliminated
