effect ground proximity aerodynamic characteristics four engined vertical take landing transport airplane model tilting wing propellers investigation made study effect ground proximity aerodynamic characteristics four engine vertical takeoff landing transport airplane model tilting wing propellers tests made wing angle incidence 90 position used vertical take landing model various heights ground lift drag pitching moment measured tuft studies made determine flow field caused propeller slipstream data obtained complete model model horizontal tail removed wingpropeller combination alone results investigation showed model hovering near ground strong upwash plane symmetry also increase lift 10 percent propeller thrust one half lift resulted increase propeller thrust one half resulted load fuselage induced upwash model approached ground also experienced increasing nose pitching moment evidently resulted load fuselage rear part longer front part addition horizontal tail located halfway vertical tail increase nose pitching moment fuselage decreased energy upwash reached tail
